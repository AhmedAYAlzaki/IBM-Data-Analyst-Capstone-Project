# Exploratory Data Analysis of the 2019 Stack Overflow Survey

## Overview
This repository contains the capstone project for the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate, focusing on the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey dataset. The analysis explores various aspects of the developer community, including demographics, job roles, programming languages, and salary trends.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files and notebooks:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzes the dataset to uncover key trends and insights about developers.
2. **Data Wrangling**: Involves cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
3. **Visualization**: Creates visual representations of the data to communicate findings effectively.
4. **Dashboard**: Combines insights and visualizations into a comprehensive dashboard for presentation.
5. **Final Report**: A comprehensive report summarizing the analysis, findings, and implications of the survey data.

## Learning Objectives
Through this project, I aimed to:
- Develop a deeper understanding of data analysis processes.
- Enhance my skills in using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Gain experience in handling real-world datasets and extracting meaningful insights.

## Key Findings
- JavaScript is the most widely used programming language among developers.
- There is a significant interest in learning new technologies, including Python and SQL.
- The survey highlights a considerable gender disparity in the tech industry.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- SQLite
- Jupyter Notebook
